- 👋 Hi, I’m @mh-amani
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding machine learning and intelligence
- 🌱 I’m currently working on [the binding problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05208)
- 💞️ I’d also be happy to collaborate on projects that require statistical modelling and working with data, specifically, if they are related to climate change and/or social good.
- 📫 You can best reach me by email.
